# Types of Hacking
We can segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked. Here is a set of examples −

- **Website Hacking** − Hacking a website means taking unauthorized control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other interfaces.

- **Network Hacking** − Hacking a network means gathering information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert, Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.

- **Email Hacking** − It includes getting unauthorized access on an Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.

- **Ethical Hacking** − Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses in a computer or network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.

- **Password Hacking** − This is the process of recovering secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.

- **Computer Hacking** − This is the process of stealing computer ID and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer system.


# Steps to perform Penetration Testing

- Planning: the planning process before the start of the pentest

- Reconnaissance: The examiner collects information about the target system before the start of the pentest

- Scanning: the Vulnerability Assessment process begins by applying the information obtained by Reconnaissance to start attacking the target system.

- Gaining Access: Attempting to exploit the vulnerabilities found by applying the information obtained from Reconnaissance and Scanning

- Maintaining Access : try to access deeper system

- Covering tracks: this phase removes evidence of exploitation occurring, such as uploading backdoors, logs

- Analysis: collects the collected information and identifies the cause for each detected vulnerability, and provides solutions to fix the detected vulnerabilities

- Reporting: the process of reporting all vulnerabilities found:
